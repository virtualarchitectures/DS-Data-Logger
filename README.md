# Data Stories Data Logger
A lightweight interface for a collection of web-based applications designed for logging geographically located data in the field on a mobile device.

The apps are intended to help people explore matters of concern and gather evidence to help them develop, create annd share data stories of their own by undertaking a 'data walk'. The apps enable you to capture and record your own data and observations about your environment while out an about 'in-the-wild'.

Features:
- Simplicity:
  - The apps are intentionally designed to be simple. All you need a mobile device with an internet connection and GPS location enabled.
  - There is nothing to download. You justt need to navigate to the following webpage: [https://virtualarchitectures.github.io/DS-Data-Logger/](https://virtualarchitectures.github.io/DS-Data-Logger/)
- Flexibility:  
  - The apps provide options to specify what types or categories of information you want to capture.
  - You can use multiple apps at the same time by having them open on separate tabs in your browser.
- Privacy:
  - The apps are self-contained, static web pages which do not transmit any data to an external server or database.
  - All of the data you capture is **private** unless you choose to export it and share it yourself.
  - Data can be exported to CSV or GeoJSON files which are then saved to local storage on your mobile device. 

**IMPORTANT: Don't forget to export your data at the end of a data walk!**

Limitations:
- If you close the browser tab an app is running on or navigate to a different web page you will typically lose your data.

The app in this repository has been forked and adapted from the [DATA_WALKING](https://github.com/DHDPIC/DATA_WALKING) repository on GitHub which was created by designer [David Hunter](http://davidhunterdesign.com/) for the Data Walking project.
